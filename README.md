# 🍔 BreakBite — Canteen Ordering App

BreakBite is a full-stack canteen food ordering application that lets students browse the canteen menu and place orders digitally, eliminating queues and manual order-taking. It features a Flutter-based mobile and web frontend (for both student/faculty and admin) with Express.js as a backend.

> **Note:** The backend is hosted on a free-tier instance. Please allow ~30 seconds for "cold start" activation upon the first request.
> 
> **Live Web App:** [https://breakbite-c33c3.web.app](https://breakbite-c33c3.web.app)

## 🛠️ Technical Challenges & Solutions

* **The Problem:** Preventing order fraud (students showing the same screenshot twice).
* **The Solution:** Developed a **Time-Locked Receipt** logic. The frontend generates a unique animated hash that expires after 120 seconds, requiring staff to verify the "live" state of the UI before dispensing food.

* **The Problem:** Handling sudden bursts of traffic during short college breaks.
* **The Solution:** Optimized backend performance by moving heavy calculations to the JavaScript layer and utilizing efficient MongoDB indexing to ensure sub-second response times for order fetches.
